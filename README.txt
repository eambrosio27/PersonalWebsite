Personal Wesbite build via project-based learning

This is my first introduction to HTML5 & CSS3! I started by using an existing template and going through the files familiarizing myself with the code and how it works. 

This project is still a work in progress as I am still making my own changes, adding my own features, and expanding my skills with HTML5 and CSS3
